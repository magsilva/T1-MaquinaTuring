The first version of this application was created in 2017 by Paulo B. Costa and
Venancius Michelan, under the MIT license. It was part of an assignment for the
course on Formal Languages, Automata and Computability, from the Computer Science
program from Federal University of Technology (UTFPR) at Campo Mourão, Paraná,
Brazil. I was the professor for that course. The application supported only
Turing machines at that time.

In 2019, I forked the code to use as an example for my classes. After several
development iterations, the application was completely rewritten. I added support
for finite automaton and stack automaton, improved debugging support and general
software design as a whole. I had kept the MIT license and, also, the authorship
information and development history from Paulo and Venancius's version of the
application.
