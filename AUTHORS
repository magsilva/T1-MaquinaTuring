The first version of this application was created in 2017 by Paulo B. Costa and
Venancius Michelan, under the MIT license. It was part of an assignment for the
course on Formal Languages, Automata and Computability, from the Computer Science
program from Federal University of Technology (UTFPR) at Campo Mourão, Paraná,
Brazil. The application supported only Turing machines at that time.

In 2019, Marco Aurélio Graciotto Silva (who was the professor of the mentioned
course) forked the code to use as an example for his classes. After several
development iterations, the application was completely rewritten. He  added support
for finite automaton and stack automaton, improved debugging support and general
software design as a whole.
